As part of this laboratory, I will try the methods and tools to enable
performing basic dynamic analysis.

The enclosed instructions will make it possible to 
perform virus examination as soon as it has started. 

Due to the malicious nature of files used, for analysis
I will use a previously prepared "Sandbox" with Windows XP (SP3) - a separate environment

Unlike static analysis, dynamic analysis will enable realistic observation
of how malware is actually running.
