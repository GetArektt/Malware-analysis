The aim of this repository is to learn  how to analyze and dissect malware to understand its behavior, purpose, and potential impact on IT systems. Throughout the course I will try to use different tools and techniques such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, hiding methods and reverse engineering.
It consists of following topics:

1. Static techniques.

2. Analysis of malware in virtual machines.

3. Dynamic analysis - sandboxes.

4. Malware behaviour.

5. Shellcode and C ++ analysis in case studies.
